# ACM Custom Word List

Here you will find ACM's custom word list for the game [Skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/).

The word list is in the file `words.txt`. Each word is on one line. The script
`turn_to_list.sh` will turn the wordlist into a list that Skribbl.io can take.
Simply copy it to the clipboard. It also generates a comma-listed text file
you can copy as well, named "list.txt".

You must run `turn_to_list.sh` before committing, as to maintain a comma-separated
list for easy copying.
